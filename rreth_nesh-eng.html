      <h1>LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FESTIVAL</h1>
      <p>
        The only festival dedicated to Kosovar composers is an important event
        on Kosovo's cultural scene. This event will serve as a platform to
        honor, preserve, and promote Kosovo's rich musical heritage. The event
        is designed to unfold as a series of activities spanning an annual
        period, with a clear goal: to create, disseminate, and protect musical
        works. Organized for the first time, this festival arises as a necessary
        step to begin a journey towards promoting Kosovar composers and
        presenting them on the Kosovar stage. Starting from the lack of space
        and expressive opportunities, this organization aims to create an
        inspiring environment by encouraging new Kosovar artistic creativity.
      </p>

      <p id="p1">
        The festival includes concerts, masterclasses, forums, or open
        discussions that represent an important step towards enriching the
        cultural and artistic life of the country.

          <h1>CAREER COMPOSERS CONCERT</h1>
          <p>
            The festival will include a special concert to honor and showcase
            the works of well-known Kosovar composers. This concert will bring
            to light their outstanding contribution to the country's music
            history. Many of their works have never been interpreted, so through
            the festival, the works of career composers will be brought to life
            through interpretation by a professional orchestra selected by the
            festival. Preparation for this grand and exciting concert will begin
            in September and continue until the concert date, which is expected
            to be in the second week of November at the Red Hall of the Youth
            Palace.

          <h1>THEMATIC CONCERT</h1>
          <p>
            The thematic concert will be a musical event organized to define and
            display a clear and consistent theme for all the works to be
            performed at the concert. Organizing a thematic concert has the
            potential to connect the audience with an important theme and create
            a rich musical and cultural experience. Along with the Italian
            Cultural Institute, for this edition, we will collaborate with the
            professional musicians group, the Italian chamber group "Trio
            Chimera", for the interpretation of works by Kosovar composers. This
            event is expected to take place in the second week of December 2024
            at the new amphitheater of the university library.

          <h1>AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING & PUBLICATION OF WORKS</h1>
          <p>
            The works performed at the planned concerts will be recorded and
            published for the purpose of documenting and archiving the works of
            Kosovar composers to preserve and disseminate the music and heritage
            of career composers and young composers more widely. This is a great
            opportunity to create a sustainable platform for local music
            creation and to honor distinguished figures in Kosovo's music
            history, making this heritage more accessible to future generations.

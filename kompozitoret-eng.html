          <p class="text-nr1">Lorenc Antoni, one of the first composers in Kosovo, was born in Skopje, Macedonia, in
            1909. In
            his family, where musical art was passionately felt, he discovered and developed his early talent. In the
            absence of opportunities for formal music education, he taught himself music and engaged in studying the
            works
            of world composers. In his career as a composer and educator, Antoni faced challenges and difficulties,
            starting
            work as a teacher in Ferizaj and later in Pristina and Prizren. For many years, he directed choirs and
            orchestras, contributing to the promotion of artistic and folk music in Kosovo.</p>

            the
            sacred work in two volumes, "Come, Let Us Sing to the Lord." Gjini was the first to compose a mass in the
